            <div id="hometext1">Humans have been domesticating animals for thousands of years. 
            While early domestication was for food, there were other animals that were domesticated and served a different purpose like dogs, cats, horses, and many others. 
            Humans have bred these animals to fulfill a purpose. But now, we are at a point in human history where most of these animals are not just pets but also our friends. 
            Animals are not mindless play things, they have emotions. We tend to forget this because we don't communicate with words but there can be an understanding between each other. 
            Even though there are many animals that live a nice and comfortable life, there are millions of animals being abused around the world (https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/animal-abuse-facts-and-statistics-2024/).
            A reminder that we as humans share some responsibility to protect them. This website is to help inform people of the history of domestication, different dog breeds, and spread awareness of animals being abused or abandoned by their fellow humans.
